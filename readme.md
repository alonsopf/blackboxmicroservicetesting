# Blackbox Microservice Testing with Kotlin and RestAssured

This repo exists as a support for the article expressing this form of testing
solution, available here: 

## Car Service
Just for fun, since the article mentions it, we use SparkJava for this service. It's 
only slightly lighter weight than a basic Spring Boot service and it serves the 
purpose. This service only serves as a placeholder here for real things that do
important work.

If SparkJava intrigues you, find more info here: http://sparkjava.com/documentation

You can find the API contract in src/main/kotlin/app/Service.kt

### Build
```commandline
cd car-service
gradle build
```

### Run
```commandline
java -jar 
```

### Test
```commandline
curl localhost:8080/api/cars
```
Should see {}

The whole conversation to create and start the car looks like this:
`curl localhost:8080/api/cars`

```json
{}
```

`curl -X PUT "localhost:8080/api/cars?make=BMW&model=X3"`
```json
{
	"carId:" 451711177
}
```

`curl localhost:8080/api/cars`
```json
{"451711177":{"car":{"make":"BMW","model":"X3"},"wheels":{},"engine":{},"seatBelt":{}}}
```

`curl localhost:8080/api/cars/451711177/ready`
```json
{
	"ready": false
}
```

Make it ready...
```commandline
curl -X PUT localhost:8080/api/cars/451711177/tightlugs
curl -X PUT localhost:8080/api/cars/451711177/startengine
curl -X PUT localhost:8080/api/cars/451711177/seatbelt
```

`curl localhost:8080/api/cars/451711177/ready`
```json
{
	"ready": true
}
```


## Food Service
Just for fun this service is in a whole different stack, NodeJS. Why? Because we want
to represent that the solution being demonstrated is purely a REST client, and the
tech stack outside that client is irrelevant.

### Build
```commandline
cd food-service
npm install
```

### Run
```commandline
npm start
```

### Test
You can run quick curl to check this server, e.g. 
`curl localhost:3000/api/order/burger?with=cheese`
or
`curl localhost:3000/api/window/`


## Suzerain
Now to the point of all this - you now have 2 microservices running API's and you 
want a "user journey" to stitch it all together and make sure things really work.
